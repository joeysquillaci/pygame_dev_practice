# pygame_dev_practice
A repo to contain a practice project using the Pygame Python library. Code and assets derived from DaFluffyPotato on Youtube.

This was a basic tutorial I followed by DaFluffyPotato (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gABYM5M0ww&t=425s) so that I could learn more about how to use the Pygame Python library. All the code and assets belong to him, uploading this to Github is just my way of documenting my Pygame journey.
